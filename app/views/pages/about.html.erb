    <h2>How did this all get started?</h2>
    <p>
      Our grandmother lived with our family when I was growing up, and unsurprisingly my brother and I are really close to her.
      Unfortunately, she's technophobic. This made it pretty tough for me to communicate with her while I was in college.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I would email my mom and have her print out my emails and show them to my grandmother. My brother has put me to shame. He's a regular
      pen pal with our grandmother. They write long handwritten lettres back and forth.
    </p>
    
    <h4>My wish</h4>
    <p>
      I wish there had been a way for me to easily send snail mail lettres to my grandmother, so she could get the excitement of getting my
      lettre in the mail.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Then it hit me. Getting mail is exciting. The problem is that it takes so much more effort than just shooting off an email. Why not make
      it super easy for people to be able to send unique snail mail lettres to each other?
    </p>
    
    <h4>My vision</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Classy Lettres</strong> is going to start with a few offerings for preparing your lettres:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Typing up your message on a typewriter</li>
      <li>Handwriting your message on nice stationary (possibly in calligraphy)</li>
      <li>Wax sealing the envelope</li>
      <li>Including a printed picture</li>
      <li>Possibly in person delivery</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
      All of these options should help to leave a truly lasting impression.
