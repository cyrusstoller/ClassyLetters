    <h2>About</h2>
    <h4>How did this all get started?</h4>
    <p>
      I am really close with my grandmother. When I moved to the east coast for college, it was really hard for me to communicate with her.
      Because she's technophobic, I would email my mom and have her print out my emails for my grandmother. 
      My brother puts me to shame; he is a regular pen pal with our grandmother.
    </p>
    
    <h4>My wish</h4>
    <p>
      I wish there had been a way for me to easily send snail mail letters to my grandmother, so she could have the excitement of getting my
      letter in the mail.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Then it hit me. Getting mail is exciting. The problem is that it takes so much more effort than just shooting off an email. Why not make
      it super easy for people to be able to send unique snail mail letters to one another?
    </p>
    
    <h4>Here's the Plan</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Classy Letters</strong> is going to start with a few offerings:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Handwritten message on nice stationary (print, cursive, or calligraphy)</li>
      <li>Wax seal the envelope</li>
      <li>Doodled border</li>
      <li>Lipstick kiss on the letter</li>
      <li>Teardrops on the stationary</li>
      <li>In-person delivery</li>
    </ol>
